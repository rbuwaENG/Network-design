# IT Company Network Design
</br>

</br>
This project outlines a comprehensive network design for an IT company with two branches, leveraging RIP routing and VLANs for efficient communication and network management. The simulation is implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Overview

The network design aims to provide a robust and scalable infrastructure for an IT company operating across two branches. Key features include dynamic routing using RIP (Routing Information Protocol) and VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) for logical network segmentation.

## Features

- **RIP Routing:** Utilizing RIP for dynamic routing to ensure efficient and adaptive routing between devices within the network.

- **VLAN Implementation:** Segmentation of the network into VLANs to enhance security, optimize traffic flow, and simplify network management.

- **Inter-VLAN Routing:** Implementation of routing between VLANs to facilitate communication between different segments of the network.

## Network Topology

## Branch 1 Configuration

- **Router 1 (R1):** RIP routing configuration, VLAN configuration, and inter-VLAN routing.

- **Switches:** VLAN assignment for various departments (e.g., Administration, Development, and Sales).

## Branch 2 Configuration

- **Router 2 (R2):** RIP routing configuration, VLAN configuration, and inter-VLAN routing.

- **Switches:** VLAN assignment for various departments.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/it-company-network-design.git
    cd it-company-network-design
    ```

2. **Open in Cisco Packet Tracer:**

    - Open the project file (`it-company-network-design.pkt`) in Cisco Packet Tracer.

3. **Explore and Simulate:**

    - Navigate through the network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer.
    - Simulate different scenarios to observe the behavior of RIP routing and VLAN segmentation.
